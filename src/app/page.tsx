                This automated toolset enables a user to specify software in a structured way, 
                resulting in provable specifications that can be checked and animated prior to 
                generating any code. As the specifications are created mathematically using 
                axiomatic reasoning, the subsequent code generation can be done automatically in minutes.

              <p className="text-body mb-8">
                The result of this is error-free code, created at the click of a button; 
                estimated to take half the time and with half the workforce of conventional methods.

                This impressive technology has been developed by leading technology expert John Warren,

              Creating "right first time" software for large modern programs is almost impossible, 
              and users are continually frustrated by needing to install patches and updates. 
              This is not an easy issue to solve as modern programs and programming languages 
              are often too complex to be fully understood and checked by individual programmers. 
              Often clients cannot specify their needs clearly, precisely, and unambiguously, 
              making it difficult for the programmer to create code without errors.

              Specify4IT creates error free database systems faster, mathematically provable, 
              in exact accordance with the required specifications.
